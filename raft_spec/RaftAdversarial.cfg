\* For TLC model checking, define:
CONSTANTS
    Server = {s1, s2, s3, s4, s5}
    Value = {v1, v2, v3}
    Nil = Nil
    Follower = Follower
    Candidate = Candidate
    Leader = Leader
    RequestVoteRequest = RequestVoteRequest
    RequestVoteResponse = RequestVoteResponse
    AppendEntriesRequest = AppendEntriesRequest
    AppendEntriesResponse = AppendEntriesResponse
    
    \* Adversarial parameters (configurable)
    MaxElectionTimeout = 10        \* Maximum election timeout
    MinElectionTimeout = 5         \* Minimum election timeout
    HeartbeatTimeout = 3           \* How often leaders send heartbeats
    MaxHeartbeatDelay = 5          \* Maximum delay of heartbeats
    MaxMessageDelay = 4            \* Maximum message delay
    MaxNetworkPartition = 2        \* Maximum nodes that can be partitioned
    MessageDropProb = 10           \* 1 in 10 messages can be dropped

\* Model checking settings

PROPERTIES
    \* Key safety and liveness properties
    EventualProgress
    SafetyUnderPartitions

\* Constraint to limit the state space exploration
CONSTRAINT StateConstraint

\* Define a state constraint to keep the model checking tractable
StateConstraint ==
    /\ \A i \in Server : Len(log[i]) <= 3
    /\ \A i \in Server : currentTerm[i] <= 5
    /\ currentTime <= 20
